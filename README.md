Android-3D-SplitScreen
======================

A small demo based off https://github.com/sebastianherp/riftlibrary (Oculus Rift) but instead of using the Oculus rift, it is designed for devices like Google Cardboard, Durovis OpenDive and vrase which turn your Android phone in to a head mounted display.

Done
Split screen locked to landscape
Currently you can move forward, backwards, side to side, via touch on left screen(eye), look around on right screen.
Now uses Google Cardboard for head tracking which improves the compatibility a lot.
Fixed a issue that caused it to crash on devices like Samsung Galaxy S2


Todo
Support game controllers
Create a more impressive demo
